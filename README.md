# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) - AI & ML Internship

## 🔍 Objective
Use Support Vector Machines for linear and non-linear binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.

---

## 📦 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- mlxtend (for decision boundary plotting)

---

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset using `scikit-learn`.
2. Preprocessed data and selected first 2 features for 2D visualization.
3. Trained:
   - SVM with **Linear Kernel**
   - SVM with **RBF Kernel**
4. Visualized decision boundaries.
5. Tuned hyperparameters `C` and `gamma` using `GridSearchCV`.
6. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and confusion matrix.

---

## 📈 Results
- Linear Kernel Accuracy: ~X%
- RBF Kernel Accuracy: ~Y%
- Best Parameters from GridSearch: `C = ___`, `gamma = ___`

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

**1. What is a support vector?**  
Points closest to the decision boundary that influence its position.

**2. What does the C parameter do?**  
Controls the trade-off between margin size and misclassification.

**3. What are kerne**
